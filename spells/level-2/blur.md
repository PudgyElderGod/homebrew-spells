## Description
Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you.
For the duration, any creature who attacks you must flip a coin.
On a tails, the attack automatically misses.
An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn't rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.
