## Description
You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a 20-foot-radius sphere within range.
The pattern lasts for the duration.
Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the creature becomes **charmed** for the duration.
While **charmed** by this spell, the creature is **incapacitated** and has a speed of 0.
A creature who is **blinded** automatically succeeds on this Saving Throw.

The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
